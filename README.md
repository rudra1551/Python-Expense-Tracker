# Python-Expense-Tracker (CLI)

A command-line based Expense Tracker built using Python to record, store, and
analyze expenses in a structured way using file handling.

This project focuses on strengthening **core Python fundamentals** rather than
using external libraries or frameworks.

data visualization, or database storage are intentionally excluded to keep the
project focused on fundamentals.
